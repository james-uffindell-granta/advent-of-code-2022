# advent-of-code-2022

Solutions for Advent of Code 2022, used as an opportunity to get more familiar with Rust.

Code's gone through minor refactorings (removing dead code, etc) and clippy linting since the challenge ended, but no significant logic or structural changes. At some point I may come back and refactor further to make it more idiomatic or performant.
